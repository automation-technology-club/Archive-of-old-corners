Just arrived 10 little boards from China...
They are using the MD-328D (a 60 cents ATMEGA328 Clone).
    This IC can run from 1.8 to 5 Volts at 20Mnz.
    Same memory.
    Faster instructions.
    2 8-bit "real" Digital-to-Analog Converters...
Can work with 3.3Volts or 5 Volts ( Jumper Selectable )
Works under the Arduino IDE... 

This microcontroller (MD-328D) will cost 60 cents in quantities (1000).
If really works, as they say, a lot of commercial products  can be developed using the Arduino.

---- 06 FEB 2017  ----------------------
This Arduino NANO Clone (Cloned board and cloned Microcontroller) is available today
for 1.99$

There is a cheaper version called "Massduino Nano Lite" ,
but an aditional USB/Serial adapter is necessary.

Demo code:
The Sketch  dac_Tone_01_Test.ino

Is used to test the Digital-to-Analog capability of the Massduino NANO.

Generating a 4.155 Khz tone of 8 cycles every 500 milliseconds.
using the DAC0 (Pin 4) of the Massduino NANO (MD-328D).
