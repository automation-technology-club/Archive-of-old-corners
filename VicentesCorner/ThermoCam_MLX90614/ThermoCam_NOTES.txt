Project name: "Narrowing the MLX90614 Infra Red Thermometer sensing area"

This project was conceived to use the MELEXIS sensor MLX90614ESF-BBA as the
sensor element of a rudimentary Single Pixel Thermographic camera.
The MLX90614ESF-BBA has a Field Of View of 90 degrees.
A ROD COUPLING NUT was used to obtain a narrow FOV.

The idea comes from other device, the MELEXIS MLX90614ESF-DCI, it has a black metal tube
attached to produce FOV of 5 degrees, it also cost five times more (recomend to obtain better results).

The concept was loose developed without changing the internal gain and filters of the sensor.
Adafruit Library was used and they doesn't provide functions to do it.
(SparkFun has a more complete library for these devices).

The use of the metal ROD decrease largely the sensisitivity of the sensor.
to compensate it without using internal gain and filters, 200 samples are added and scaled
for each measurement.

 
The code for this project is in the "Code" folder:

Arduino code:
/*One_Pixel_ThermoCam_02.ino  Agrucho 4 JAN 2017
Using the MLX90614 temperature sensor, attached to a 5/15" ROD COUPLING NUT
for more directional sensing (lower gain and sensitivity).
A Servo controlled Pan and Tilt is used to scan 30 lines of 40 readings.

Processing is used to display the thermal image: Pro_ThermoCam_01.pde
