
Arduino code:
/*One_Pixel_ThermoCam_02.ino  Agrucho 4 JAN 2017
Using the MLX90614 temperature sensor, attached to a 5/15" ROD COUPLING NUT
for more directional sensing (lower gain and sensitivity).
A Servo controlled Pan and Tilt is used to scan 30 lines of 40 readings.

Processing is used to display the thermal image: Pro_ThermoCam_01.pde

Processing code:
/*Pro_ThermoCam_01.pde   Agrucho 04JAN 2017
Presentation of an image (40x30) pixels.
Data send by the Arduino at 115200 bauds.
Works with the Arduino Sketch: One_Pixel_ThermoCam_02.ino
